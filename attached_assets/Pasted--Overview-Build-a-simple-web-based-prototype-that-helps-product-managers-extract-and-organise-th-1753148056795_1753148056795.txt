**Overview:** Build a simple web-based prototype that helps product managers extract and organise themes from user interview transcripts using AI analysis.

**Core Features:**

1. Paste research text or Upload files
    - Main tab: A window allows user to paste research text
    - Drag-and-drop interface supporting .txt, .doc, .docx, .md, .pdf files
    - Make sure that the text is cleanly formatted for AI parsing
    - Multiple file upload capability
2. **AI Theme Extraction**
    - Analyse transcripts using semantic clustering to identify recurring themes
    - Extract 5-10 key themes per project (across all uploaded transcripts)
    - Generate supporting quotes for each theme (2-3 quotes minimum)
    - Highlight relevant portions of transcripts in bold
3. **Visual Theme Presentation**
    - Display themes as colorful post-it note style cards
    - Each theme card shows: theme title, supporting quotes, source transcript references
    - Use distinct colors for different themes
    - Mimic Miro-style clustering layout
4. **User Interaction & Refinement**
    - Allow users to edit theme titles and descriptions
    - Enable merging/splitting of themes
    - Add/remove supporting quotes
    - Implement feedback system to improve future extractions
5. **Export Functionality**
    - Export options: Excel, Google Sheets, PDF, Word Doc
    - Include theme summary, supporting quotes, and source references
6. **Settings & Preferences**
    - User preference settings for theme extraction sensitivity
    - Option to focus on specific types of themes (pain points, feature requests, behaviors)
    - Save extraction preferences per user

**Technical Requirements:**

- Use semantic text analysis for theme clustering
- Implement in-memory storage (no localStorage/sessionStorage)
- Responsive design for desktop/tablet use
- Handle text parsing for multiple file formats
- Include error handling for file processing

**User Workflow:**

1. Paste research text, OR Drag and drop transcript files
2. AI processes and extracts themes
3. Review themes in post-it note interface
4. Edit/refine themes as needed
5. User can also collapse the themes, and reorder the themes as needed 
6. Export results in preferred format

**UI/UX Specifications:**

- Clean, modern interface with PM-friendly design
- Color-coded theme cards with hover effects
- Intuitive drag-and-drop zone
- Progress indicators during processing
- Friendly error message
