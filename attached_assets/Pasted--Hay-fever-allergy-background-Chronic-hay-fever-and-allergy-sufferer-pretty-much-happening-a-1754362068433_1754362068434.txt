### Hay fever, allergy background

- Chronic hay fever and allergy sufferer, pretty much happening all year around
- Had skin test pin prick for different kinds of allergens at primary school: tested for pollen, grass, dust mites, etc and even did ‘drops under the tongue’ immunotherapy for a couple of months, but nothing really happened. Couldn’t remember why they decided to stop the immunotherapy
- Essentially, ‘how do you avoid grass and dust?’
- Things can get pretty bad in spring

### Hayfever management

- In the last 5 years, just have Telfast non-stop every day
- If stop taking it, can feel the difference: going outside and have itchy eyes.
- Also have post-nasal drip, have to do nasal rinse whenever feel clogged up or issues with sinuses
- Has sensitive sinuses, any changes in environment could set it off eg sitting near the door and has a whiff of cold air
- Cycling a lot, and in spring, if cycling on a windy day, with visible pollen it can be pretty noticeable
- Started wearing a mask when cycling before covid, but it could get annoying: too many things around the ears, helmets and masks.
- Subscribes to government air quality alerts, mainly about smokes, backburning.
- Tries to vacuum every week, as allergic to dust mites
- Thinking about getting an air purifier for the bedroom, as sometimes the air feels skanky when it’s been raining a lot, or when it’s too windy with pollen outside
- Has Nasonex, a cortisol nasal spray, hayfever relief and prevention, when feeling really bad in spring, but not using it much

### Reminders

- Trying to do anything daily is hard!’
- Using MediSafe, an app for daily reminder for Telfast medication but push notification is not enough
- Also has a bright smart light, shining to her face in the morning as a harsh reminder to take medications before turning it off

### Symptom correlations

- Used AirQuality App before but stopped using as it didn’t really correlate to symptoms
- Had some bad days and looked at the app but all indicators were green
- Tried to look for specific items that might be different to correlate with symptoms, but couldn’t find anything consistently correlated - gave up usage after a couple of months
- Message other people like her sister on ‘bad days’ or colleagues with hayfever, to check-in about their symptoms, to not feel crazy, to validate the issues, and try to find correlation or root causes
